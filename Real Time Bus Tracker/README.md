# PacMan

The bus tracker displays the various bus stops that reside between MIT and Harvard. This project leverages the powerful Mapbox API, resulting in a dynamic and interactive user experience.

# How-to-Run

Clone the repository to your local machine. Open the "index.html" file to load the webpage into your local browser.Click on the button "Show stops from MIT to Harvard" to start the bus that stops at each of the bus stations between MIT and Harvard.

# Roadmap of future improvements
Create a start field and a destination field to allow users input different start points and destination, allow the tracker to show customized real time bus stops accordingly.
