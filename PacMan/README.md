# PacMan

The webpage has a PacMan image moving horizontally across the width of the page. The code checks for collisions with the window boundaries and changes the direction of the PacMan images accordingly.

# How-to-Run

Clone the repository to your local machine. Open the "index.html" file to load the webpage into your local browser.

# Roadmap of future improvements

Add some small PacMan to the game so that the big PacMan could eat small ones when it moves
